## Title: Transcriptomic Cross Tissue Analysis of Key Developmental Genes in Zebrafish

## Proposal:



## Example Published Figure: ![](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06720-2/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6720_Fig5_HTML.png?as=webp)

## Datasets: 

Primary Dataset https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01147-4#fig1 

Secondary Dataset (for stretch goals) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06720-2 

## Software/Tools:

Bioconductor, version 1.18.0, https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/

Potential Additional Tools:
https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene 
https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/zebrahub_analysis

## Goals: 

1) Pick one gene and do a cross sectional tissue comparison within an embryonic zebrafish dataset. Represent this with clustering and a heat map. From there could compare multiple genes of interest.

2) (Stretch) Do a timepoint comparison of a gene within a tissue set and potentially expand at a certain timepoint across tissues if gene is of interest (highly expressed).

3) (Strech-Strech) Use another zebrafish data set and compare results between data sets.
